# ❄️ AI-Based Avalanche Risk Prediction & Early Warning System

This project is an AI-driven Avalanche Early Warning System designed to **predict avalanche risk levels** based on real-time terrain and environmental parameters.  
Using a **Random Forest Machine Learning model**, the system efficiently analyzes slope, elevation, aspect, and region data to classify potential avalanche risks in Himalayan regions.
